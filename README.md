# Striker (Rust)

Striker is a Blackjack simulation and analysis tool written in Rust. It supports multiple player strategies, deck configurations, and is built for high-performance simulations across multiple threads.

> This project is part of a multi-language software engineering demonstration. See the full collection at [rees.me](http://rees.me).

## Features

- Supports multiple Blackjack strategies:
  - Mimic dealer
  - Basic strategy
  - Linear regression
  - Polynomial regression
  - Neural network-based strategy
  - High-low counting
  - Wong counting
- Deck configurations:
  - Single-deck
  - Double-deck
  - Six-deck shoe
- Highly parallel simulations using multi-threading
- Configurable simulation parameters via command-line arguments
- Outputs JSON reports (ideal for downstream visualization or data analysis)

## Usage

### Build

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Run

```bash
./target/release/striker-rust [options]
```

### Options

| `-h`, `--number-of-hands` `<n>`     | Number of hands to simulate                           |
| `-t`, `--number-of-threads` `<n>`   | Number of threads to use                              |
| `-M`, `--mimic`                     | Use the mimic dealer player strategy                  |
| `-B`, `--basic`                     | Use the basic player strategy                         |
| `-L`, `--linear`                    | Use the linear regression player strategy             |
| `-P`, `--polynomial`                | Use the polynomial regression player strategy         |
| `-N`, `--neural`                    | Use the neural network player strategy                |
| `-H`, `--high-low`                 | Use the high-low count player strategy                |
| `-W`, `--wong`                      | Use the Wong count player strategy                    |
| `-1`, `--single-deck`              | Use a single deck of cards and rules                  |
| `-2`, `--double-deck`              | Use a double deck of cards and rules                  |
| `-6`, `--six-shoe`                 | Use a six-deck shoe of cards and rules                |

### Example

```bash
./target/release/striker-rust -B -2 -h 100000 -t 8
```

This runs a simulation using the **basic strategy** on a **double-deck** game for **100,000 hands** using **8 threads**.
